Dear hakkers,


We are proud to announce the fourteenth maintenance release of Akka 2.4 which contains a number of improvements and bugfixes.

Some notable changes are:

 * When reading snapshots fails for a persistent actor it will now cause recovery failure [#21842](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21842)
 * Performance improvements for the LocalSnapshotStore [#20821](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20821)
 * Attributes on flatMapConcat/flatMapMerge now propagated to the inner streams [#21743](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21743)
 * Methods around actor selection returning Java CompletionStages [#21726](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21726)
 * gzip/deflate Flows have been moved to Akka-Streams from Akka HTTP, so that they can be used in any streaming application [#21395](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21395)


## Akka HTTP 

Akka HTTP is not part of this release as it has moved to it’s own repository and will be released as soon as possible, as Akka 10.0.0.
Keep your eyes out for an annoucement about it very soon.

## Skip Akka 2.4.13, due to uncovered regression

Please note that the `2.4.13` release contained a bug in the `ByteStringParser` that we noticed immediately after releasing, and decided to not announce that version - please upgrade immediately to `2.4.14` instead (or higher, as new versions become available). We will invest in strengthening downstream-dependency testing throughout the coming sprints, to avoid such issue from happening again.

## Credits
A total 39 issues were closed since 2.4.12.
The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [2.4.14 milestone on github](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/99?closed=1).

For this release we had the help of 20 committers – thank you all very much!
