title: Akka 2.2.1 Released!
author: Endre Sándor Varga
short: Akka 2.2.1 Released
---

Dear hAkkers,

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of ***Akka 2.2.1***. This is the first maintenance release of the 2.2 branch, containing documentation improvements and fixing several issues including:

  * Convenience method for looking up ActorRef via ActorSelection
  * Configurable dispatcher for internal remoting actors
  * Java support of ask pattern using ActorSelection as target
  * Less noisy and more configurable logging of remoting events

 ... and several smaller fixes
 
 *This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.2.0, which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies. Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.*

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the SBT standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10”.
