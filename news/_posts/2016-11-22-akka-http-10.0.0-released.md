title: Akka HTTP 10.0.0 "X" Released!

short: Akka HTTP 10.0.0 "X" Released!
---

Dear hakkers,

Today, we are proud and happy to announce the immediate availability of 
the fully stable version of Akka HTTP – 10.0.0, charmingly code named 
"X" by @jonas on gitter!

Please note that while the version number changed significantly, the 
actual surface APIs did not by much. The akka-http-core module was 
already stable back in Akka 2.4, so it remained binary compatible, and 
the sources for akka-http are almost completely compatible with those 
that were shipped as Akka 2.4.11 – you should not have any trouble upgrading. 

From here-on the Akka HTTP releases will respect binary compatibility, 
as expected from stable Akka modules. We will also try out a novel way 
of introducing new APIs, by shipping them in the stable modules however 
marking them as "experimental" or “not-sure-if-we-keep-them” so you’d be 
able to opt-in into those on a case-by case basis. This idea is under 
discussion in the [Consider @Experimental / @ApiMayChange markers on APIs](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/438) issue on github.

Along with the new version, and stability of all of the modules, we 
expect the community to quickly catch up with releasing the various 
support projects for the new version, such as [akka-http-cors](https://github.com/lomigmegard/akka-http-cors), 
[akka-sse](https://github.com/hseeberger/akka-sse), 
[akka-http-session](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session), 
[akka-http-json](https://github.com/hseeberger/akka-http-json). 
This includes cross releases for Scala 2.12, for which Akka HTTP is now available as well.

## Documentation

The [documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current) is available 
under a separate directory under doc.akka.io, and will follow the following 
scheme: `doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/[version]/`, the usual "current" symlink 
is also available and we recommend using that if linking to Akka 
documentation from external sites such as stack overflow or blogs. 

The documentation has moved to the [Lightbend Paradox](https://github.com/lightbend/paradox) 
tool, which allows us to write documentation using extended markdown, instead of 
restructuredtext which we found was making it difficult for first time contributors.
Thanks a lot, [@jonas](https://github.com/jonas), who contributed the biggest part of
the conversion!

We are currently working on a redesign of the documentation pages, so they 
will soon get a shiny new look. Please bear with us during the transition 
period. Other projects, like Alpakka, Reactive Kafka have also already adopted 
Paradox, and Akka itself will soon follow as well. We will be able to provide 
very interesting features thanks to Paradox, keep your eyes peeled for them soon.

As always, help is very welcome, and if you find a part of the documentation 
you’d like to see improved, please [open tickets or send in pull requests](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
directly, thanks in advance!

## Versioning

Akka HTTP from here-on will be versioned separately from Akka "core". 
The original purpose of these projects sharing their version number was 
that Akka HTTP was evolving and providing many real-world requirements 
for the Akka Streams implementation, thus they were developed together. 
Now that both projects are stable, we want to be able to move them more 
independently.

The version scheme will follow semantic versioning, breaking changes will 
only be made in major releases (i.e. the next one being 11.0.0). However 
we will also introduce a new way of marking experimental APIs released 
inside existing modules – for a discussion on this please see the issue 
[akka/akka-http#3](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/3).

The `-experimental` suffix has now been dropped for all of Akka HTTP's module. 
During the transition period make sure not to transitively depend on old artifacts
that still carry the suffix (like `akka-http-experimental`). Otherwise, you could
end up with multiple versions of the same classes on the classpath.

This version of Akka HTTP depends on Akka 2.4.14, since some critical 
fixes and improvements were made in the recent version of Akka.

## Community

We consider ourselves very lucky that we have such vibrant and helpful 
community around Akka, and Akka HTTP specifically. In recent months we 
started to include more community members in our github teams for the 
various projects ([reactive-kafka](https://github.com/akka/reactive-kafka), 
[alpakka](https://github.com/akka/alpakka), akka-http), and plan on 
continuing to do so. If you’re interested in becoming part of our 
extended teams, please read: [Akka HTTP - stable, growing and tons of opportunity](https://github.com/akka/akka-meta/issues/27) 
on akka-meta and keep hakking :-)

## Credits

A total 22 issues were closed since the last release candidate, most 
of the work has been fixes, stability improvements and preparing for the 
upcoming stable release.

The complete list of closed issues since the split from Akka 2.4.11 can 
be found on the [3.0.0-RC1](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/1?closed=1),
