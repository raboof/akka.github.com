title: Akka 2.3.1 Released!
author: Endre Sándor Varga
short: Akka 2.3.1 Released
---

*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.1. This is the first maintenance release of the 2.3 branch, containing documentation improvements and fixing several issues including:

 - Simplified receive definition and support for supervision strategies for Java 8
 - Support for receiving ConfirmablePersistent messages and using become() during recovery in EventSourcedProcessor
 - Fixed actor leak during repeated remote deployment
 - More robust failure handling in cluster sharding
 - Prevent Quarantine state being lost
 - Proxy for ClusterSingletons (by Giovanni Botta)
 - Ability to use an external Camel context (by Thibaut Robert) 

This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.3.0 which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.
