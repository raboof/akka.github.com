*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.15.
This is the 15th maintenance release of the 2.3 branch.
This release features fixes that have been gathered since the previous release, among which:

- Various fixed leaks:
  - Nepotism in AbstractNodeQueue causing excessive garbage in old-gen ([#19216](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19216))
  - Non-closed Gzip streams in Clustering, causing off-heap memory leak ([#19821](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/19821))
  - Memory leak in AddressTerminated topic ([#19720](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/19720))
  - Remoting leaks actors if many systems join and leave ([#18353](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/18353))
- Fixed issue causing mismatched acknowledge numbers causing restarted systems to be Quarantined ([#20111](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/20111))
- More robust handling of hanging connections in remoting ([#19748](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19748))

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.15 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.15).

Akka 2.3.15 is released for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).
Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.15/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.
