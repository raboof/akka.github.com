# AKKA.IO

This repository contains the source of the [akka.io](http://akka.io) website. It's built using Jekyll, and designed with a touch of Twitter's Bootstrap, and other homebaked ingredients.

These instructions are mostly intended for akka committers who would like to update the site (i.e., adding a news item).

## Dependencies

You'll need Jekyll installed. Please make sure that it is version 1.0.2 of Jekyll since that is what is used by GitHub. To get it, most people can install via RubyGems:

    gem install jekyll
    gem install kramdown

OSX users might have to update RubyGems:

    sudo gem update --system

If in doubt, head over to the [Jekyll wiki](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for installation instructions.

## Building

After cloning, cd into the `akka/akka.github.com` directory and run:

    jekyll serve --config _config_local.yml

To see the generated site, just visit `http://localhost:4000`.

To watch for changes:

    jekyll serve --watch --config _config_local.yml

## Adding a News Item

News Items must be:

1. written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
2. named according to the following convention: `YYYY-MM-dd-your-title.md`, where of course `YYYY` is the 4-digit year, `MM` is the 2-digit month, and `dd` is the 2-digit day of the month.
3. placed into the `news/_posts/` directory
4. contain YAML front matter

The YAML front matter for news items can come in one of three flavors.

For a standard news item that contains a significant body of text, the following YAML front matter will suffice:

    ---
    layout: news
    title: Your Title
    author: Your Name
    ---

    Write your news article here, and make sure it's in markdown!

In this case, the first 30 or so words will be taken from the body of the news item and displayed on the front page of akka.io.

However, if you'd like to override the text that's displayed, you could use the following YAML front matter:

    ---
    layout: news
    title: Your Title
    author: Your Name
    short: A short description should be written here. This is what's rendered on the front page.
    ---

    Write your news article here, and make sure it's in markdown!

Here, whatever text is written in the `short` field of the front matter will be displayed on the front page of akka.io, underneath the title of the news item.

For a news item which points to another article outside of akka.io, the following YAML front matter will suffice:

    ---
    layout: news
    title: Your Title
    author: Your Name

    short: A short description should be written here. This is what's rendered on the front page.
    link-out: http://link-to-whatever-site-has-the-article.com
    ---

In this case, the text in the `short` field will be what is displayed on the front page of akka.io. The URL in the `link-out` field will be what the title of the article links to on the front page of akka.io. There should be no body below the YAML front matter for these news articles.
