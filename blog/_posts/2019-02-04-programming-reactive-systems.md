Akka team and Scala Center create new online course on designing and implementing reactive systems using Scala and Akka.

Set your watches and check your calendars: on Feb 18, 2019 a new course will open on the edX platform! “[Programming Reactive Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/programming-reactive-systems)” has been created by former Akka team lead and co-author of the Reactive Manifesto [Dr. Roland Kuhn](https://www.rolandkuhn.com/), long-time Akka team and Reactive Streams expert group member [Konrad Malawski](https://www.kto.so/), and [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) director of education [Julien Richard-Foy](http://julien.richard-foy.fr/).

This course covers everything from asynchronous programming techniques, over the [reactive principles](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/), including a thorough introduction to distributed systems as well as leading edge knowledge on using type systems within this context, up to processing large streams of data with limited resources using [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/). These topics are discussed and illustrated with examples using [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Akka](https://akka.io/).

It’s been five years since the publication of the [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) and since the first “Principles of Reactive Programming” course was launched on Coursera. Now we are excited to offer the follow-on course to study at your own pace. Watch out for more updates over the next weeks!
