Dear hakkers,

we—the Akka committers—are proud to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.4.
This release contains a number of minor improvements and fixes spread out across many of the Akka modules and the documentation.
Some noteworthy changes in the 2.4.7 release are:

 * A resource leak in remoting fixed, and this also solved a problem when quickly reconnecting a cluster node multiple times in a sequence ([#20523](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20523), [#20639](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20639))
 * Easy usage of a circuit breaker from the HTTP routing DSLs ([#20198](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20198))
 * Akka persistence now has got a timeout for recovery events ([#20698](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20698))

The full list of changes since the last milestone is available under the [2.4.7 milestone on github](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.7+is%3Aclosed) for your reference.

*Credits*

Thanks to the Community! For this release we had the help of 32 committers
Special thanks for all contributions to the Java DSL documentation ([#20466](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20466)), it is great to see so many new contributors!
