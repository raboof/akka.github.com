Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. Notable changes relative to 2.6.4 include:

* Harden `ShardCoordinator` state update guarantees, including new update strategies in Distributed Data, [#28856](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28856)
* Fix CBOR format in JacksonSerializer. In Akka 2.6.0 - 2.6.4 the JacksonSerializer was using JSON format also when configured to use CBOR. To be able to support rolling updates that is the case also for 2.6.5, but in upcoming 2.6.6 it will by default use correct CBOR format. It's possible to enable this already in 2.6.5, see [rolling updates change log](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/rolling-update.html#2-6-5-jacksoncborserializer). [#28918](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28918)
* Change cluster serializer to not use full class manifest. For rolling update you must update via 2.6.2, 2.6.3 or 2.6.4 when upgrading to 2.6.5. See [rolling update change log](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/rolling-update.html#2-6-2-clustermessageserializer-manifests-change). [#13654](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/13654)
* New Persistence TestKit, [see documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/persistence-testing.html#persistence-testkit), thanks to [@manonthegithub](https://github.com/manonthegithub), [#15571](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15571)
* New TestKit for `EventSourcedBehavior`, [see documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/persistence-testing.html), [#23712](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23712)
* Allow changing the recovery strategy for `EventSourcedBehavior`, thanks to [@an-tex](https://github.com/an-tex), [#25216](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25216)
* Fix missing `Receptionist` subscription notification for some edge cases, [#28792](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28792)
* Fix `DispatcherSameAsParent` when using Cluster, [#28842](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28842)
* Allow `Source.queue` concurrent pushing, thanks to [@yakivy](https://github.com/yakivy), [#28272](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28272)
* Exponential backoff in `RetrySupport`, thanks to [@hepin1989](https://github.com/hepin1989)
* Possibility to run ActorTestKit with custom ActorSystem, thanks to [@Reklund3](https://github.com/Reklund3), [#27338](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/27338)
* Update Aeron to 1.27.0, [#28866](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28866)
