Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce the 2.5.29 patch release of Akka 2.5. The release contains backports of a few important fixes.

Notable changes:

* Improve performance of composite `ByteString.toArray`. [#28137](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28137)
* Fix memory leak of restarting Artery outbound stream. [#28390](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28390)
* Backport some of the SystemMaterializer API. [#28494](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28494)
* Timestamp in EventEnvelope of Persistence Query. Persistence plugins should start using it. [#28331](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28331)

Version 2.5.28 was never announced because it included a major regression due to the the change of the `EventEnvelope`. Thanks to [@nvollmar](https://github.com/nvollmar) for finding and fixing. [#28532](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28532)


A total of 10 issues were closed since 2.5.27. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.28](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/158?closed=1) and [2.5.29 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/160?closed=1) on github.
