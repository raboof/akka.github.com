Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.1.12 release of Akka HTTP. This release is the 12th update in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

### Changes since 10.1.11

For a full overview you can also see the [10.1.12 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/54?closed=1):

ALPN support was backported to JDK 8 starting at update 252. When using HTTP2 support with these JDKs, the `jetty-alpn-agent`
is not needed anymore. If you want to run on older and newer JDKs with the same command line, make sure to use the
most recent version of `jetty-alpn-agent` which will automatically disable itself for newer JDKs.
