Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. This release brings important fixes for Akka Stream performance regressions in [Source.fromPublisher](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30022) and [Flow.future and Flow.prefixAndTail](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/30039).

Note that this release may need your project to upgrade to the latest Scala version to compile (Scala 2.13.4+ or 2.12.13+) because of an issue with the `@nowarn` annotation [#30018](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30018). If not compilation may fail with this error:

```
Symbol 'type scala.annotation.nowarn' is missing from the classpath.
```

Other noteworthy improvements in this release:

 * SBR downing when it knows it has been quarantined by a remote cluster node [#29565](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29565)
 * Separate logger for Akka internal log entries in EventSourcedBehavior [#30005](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30005)
 * Typed teskit would double-dilate configured timeouts [#30021](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30021)
 * Full cluster shutdown [#29838](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/29838)

2.6.13 includes 28 closed issues. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.13 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/174?closed=1) on github.
