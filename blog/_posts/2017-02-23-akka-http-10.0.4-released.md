Dear hakkers,

we — the Akka HTTP committers — are happy to announce the availability of the forth maintenance release of Akka HTTP 10.0.

This release is a monthly maintenance release which contains mostly bug fixes and smaller improvements.

We strongly recommend updating from 10.0.3 which introduced a regression that an Akka HTTP server can leak memory
over time which will lead to OOM eventually. See [#851](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/851) for more information.

In other news, the [Akka Http Team](https://github.com/orgs/akka/teams/akka-http-team) welcomes [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat)
as an Akka Http committer!

### List of Changes

#### Improvements

##### akka-http-core
 * Http message and header parser now also accepts LF as end of line (as recommended in the spec) ([#106](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/106))

##### akka-http
 * `HttpApp` now directly extends from Directives ([#875](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/875))
 * Added `HttpApp.startServer(host, port)` for even simpler startup. ([#873](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/873))

##### akka-http2-support
 * Multiplexer infrastructure was rewritten to support plugable `StreamPrioritizer` (not yet surfaced in user API) ([f06ab40](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/commit/f06ab40))

##### Documentation
 * New documentation page about how to deal with the client-side `max-open-requests` exception ([39f36dd](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/commit/39f36dd))
 * Lots of small cleanups and improvements

#### Bug fixes

##### akka-http-core
 * Fix a regression introduced in 10.0.3 that might lead to memory leaking after a server connection has been closed. ([#851](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/851))
 * Fix the infamous "Cannot push/pull twice" bug which occurred in relation with 100-Continue requests (like any kind
   of uploads of POST requests done with `curl`) ([#516](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/516))

##### Build + Testing Infrastructure
 * Updated Akka dependency to Akka 2.4.17. ([#858](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/858))
 * Use `.dilated` for tests for better stability. ([#194](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/194))
 * Fix MiMa to actually check compatibility against the latest released versions. ([#870](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/870))
 * Throughout the code base `@InternalApi`, `@ApiMayChange`, and `@DoNotInherit` annotations have been added
   to give hints about the stability of interfaces. ([#727](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/727))

## Binary Compatibility

Akka 10.0.x is backwards binary [compatible](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5-M1/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html)
with previous 10.0.x releases and Akka 2.4.x. This means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for
the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).
It should be noted that Scala 2.12.x is is not binary compatible with Scala 2.11.x.

Akka-Http will be binary and source compatible with the upcoming Akka 2.5 release.
