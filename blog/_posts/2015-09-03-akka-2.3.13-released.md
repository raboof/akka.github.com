*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.13. This is the 13th maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains a few important fixes:

* backport ClusterClient failure detection improvement
* fix AbstractFSM.onTransition recursion
* set tcpNoDelay on Netty child channels
* a fix for a potential PermGen leak problem
* clear pending connections after quarantine

Akka 2.3.13 is released for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.13/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.12 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.13).
