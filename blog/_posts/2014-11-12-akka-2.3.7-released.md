*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.7. This is the seventh maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. Among other fixes and improvements this release contains:

 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16199) for a missing predicate parameter in the FSM contributed by [litomSegal](https://github.com/litomSegal).
 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16198) in the FSM docs contributed by [kosii](https://github.com/kosii).
 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15991) for a race between sending out acks and UpdatePendingWrite in akka-io. Contributed by [jrudolph](https://github.com/jrudolph).
 - [An optimization](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16286) for Mailbox bringing Actor performance improvements.
 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15766) for akka-io which adds a workaround for Windows to detect connection reset events.
 - [A fix](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16009) for akka-persistance where there was no default serializer provided for SnapshotHeader.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.7 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.7+is%3Aclosed).

Akka 2.3.7 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.4. This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.3.6 which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.
