Dear hakkers,

we—the Akka committers—are proud to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.4.

This release contains a number of fixes and improvements spread out across many of the Akka modules and the documentation. As usual, this version is a drop-in replacement for any previous 2.4.x series version and maintains binary compatibility according to the rules [outlined here](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html).

Some noteworthy changes in the 2.4.8 release are:

* HTTP Connection Pools don’t cache a resolved DNS address forever anymore (which is useful for DNS based service location) ([#20690](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20690))
* HTTP Connection Pools can be configured to keep a "hot" number of connections open eagerly, to decrease first-request-on-pool latency significantly ([20456](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20456))
* Ported "Handling Blocking operations" document from an excellent StackOverflow [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34641861/akka-http-blocking-in-a-future-blocks-the-server/34645097#34645097) ([#20469](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/20469))
* Distributed Data now takes advantage of the WeaklyUp state ([#18399](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/18399))

The full list of changes since the last milestone is available under the [2.4.8](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/89?closed=1) milestone on github for your reference.

**Akka Team Blog**

As already announced over various other channels earlier this week–we're re-launching the [Akka Team Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog)!
If you're interested in some top notch technical content straight from the team, we recommend to give it a look (and subscribe). 

The content on the blog will be more 'lose', while we keep the news section of the [akka.io](https://akka.io) site for... news. 
Please look forward to our new tech posts on the blog, and more upcoming release announcements on the new section of the Akka site (here).

**Credits**

Thanks to the Community! For this release we had the help of 40 committers.

Especially we would like to thanks the various hakkers who helped migrate the Akka Streams internals to the new and awesome GraphStage in a [great](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20466) [collaborative](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20288) [effort](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19361) over the last month. Thanks @Hawstein, @gosubpl, @RichardImaoka, @fagossa, @Zhxiaogg, @danxmoran and everyone contributing to this effort!

We also would like to give a special thanks to 4 of [scalac](http://scalac.io)‘s developers (Patryk, Michał, Piotr and Krzysztof) for collaborating with us more closely this month. While learning the ropes of Akka HTTP internals they were able to contribute some useful and challenging features–we’re hoping to see more of those in the future. Thanks a lot!
