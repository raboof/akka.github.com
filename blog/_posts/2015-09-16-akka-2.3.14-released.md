*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.14. 
This is the 14th maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. 
This release features a single yet important fix to the ClusterClient:

* ClusterClient doesn't reconnect when server restarts quickly [#18459](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/18459)

Akka 2.3.14 is released for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).
Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.14/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.14 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.14).
