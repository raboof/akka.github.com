Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce version 1.1.0 of [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/)!

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a transport mechanism for request/response and
(non-persistent) streaming use cases. See
[Why gRPC?](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/whygrpc.html) for more 
information about when to use gRPC as your transport.

## Highlights

### Supported by Lightbend

This module is now officially
[Supported](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/introduction/getting-help/support-terminology.html)
as part of a [Lightbend Subscription](https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-subscription).


## Changes since 1.0.x

Akka gRPC 1.1.0 requires Akka 2.6.x and Akka HTTP 10.2.x.

This release introduces a new, experimental client backend powered by Akka-HTTP. The default backend is still the classic client implemented using `grpc-java` which is based on Netty. You can enable the new backend using `akka.grpc.client."*".backend="akka-http"`. The Akka-HTTP backend for gRPC is built using the Akka HTTP client support for HTTP/2 introduced in [Akka HTTP 10.2.3](https://akka.io/blog/news/2021/01/18/akka-http-10.2.3-released). The Akka-HTTP backend for Akka gRPC client is released as a preview and the recommendation for general purpose usage is still the existing, netty-based backend.
