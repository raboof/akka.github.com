Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. The release contains a set of smaller fixes.

Notable changes:

* Avoid too early shutdown of Sharding coordinator, which could result in wrong state when graceful leaving [#28093](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28093). Thanks to [@retriku](https://github.com/retriku).
* Backport serialization support for StreamRefs [#28215](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28215)
* Backport improved ByteString.toArray performance under Scala 2.13 [#28114](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28114).

A total of 8 issues were closed since 2.5.26. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.27 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/153?closed=1) on github.
