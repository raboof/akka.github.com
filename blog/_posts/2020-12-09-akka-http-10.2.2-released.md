Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.2 release of Akka HTTP. This release is the second update in the 10.2.x series of Akka HTTP.

### Changes since 10.2.1

For a full overview you can also see the [10.2.2 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/59?closed=1).
Notably, we have made various improvements to the HTTP/2 server support
while we continue to prepare for providing HTTP/2 support at the client as
well.

As of this version, it is no longer strictly necessary to depend no a separate
'akka-http2-support' artifact to get HTTP/2 support in Akka HTTP. We will
continue to publish an empty artifact with that name to make it easy to
upgrade, however.
