title: Akka gRPC 1.0.0 Released
author: Arnout Engelen
short: Announcing Akka gRPC 1.0.0
category: news
tags: [releases]
---

Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce version 1.0.0 of [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/)!

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a transport mechanism for request/response and
(non-persistent) streaming use cases. See
[Why gRPC?](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/whygrpc.html) for more 
information about when to use gRPC as your transport.

## Highlights

### Supported by Lightbend

Starting at Akka gRPC 1.0.0, this module is now officially
[Supported](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/introduction/getting-help/support-terminology.html)
as part of a [Lightbend Subscription](https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-subscription).

### API stability

With version 1.0.0 we will start to provide a level of
[binary compatibility](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/binary-compatibility.html)
so you can have different versions of Akka gRPC as transitive dependencies.

Akka gRPC 1.0.0 still supports Akka 2.5.x and Akka HTTP 10.1.x, but we have made
the necessary preparations so that the APIs will work smoothly with Akka 2.6.x
and Akka HTTP 10.2.x (yet to be released) as well.
