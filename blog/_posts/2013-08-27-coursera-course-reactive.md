We are proud to announce that Akka Tech Lead Dr. Roland Kuhn will co-present
the Coursera course on the [Principles of Reactive
Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) together with Prof.
Martin Odersky and Prof. Erik Meijer of LINQ and Rx fame. This follow-on course
on Martin Odersky’s [Functional Programming Principles in
Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) will guide you through the core
concepts outlined in the [Reactive
Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/), illustrating the techniques
using Scala’s
[Futures](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html), Netflix’
[RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/tree/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-scala)
and [Akka actors](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/general/actors.html).
Typesafe is offering [online
tutoring](http://typesafe.com/blog/announcing_typesafe_new_coursera_tutoring_program)
accompanying the course.

Looking forward to seeing you all in class!
