Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce version 2.0.0 of [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/)!

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a transport mechanism for request/response and
(non-persistent) streaming use cases. See
[Why gRPC?](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/whygrpc.html) for more 
information about when to use gRPC as your transport.

## Highlights

This version of Akka gRPC updates from ScalaPB 0.10.x to 0.11.x, which is a
breaking change for Scala users: code generated with ScalaPB 0.10.x will not
work with version 0.11.x of the runtime, meaning projects that use Akka gRPC
directly need a clean recompile, and if you use libraries that use Akka gRPC
you will need to make sure they are on the same major version.
