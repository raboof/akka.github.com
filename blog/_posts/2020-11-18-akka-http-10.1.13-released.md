Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.1.13 release of Akka HTTP. This release is the 13th update in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

This is a small maintenance release which fixes a bug in the client connection pool and optimizes some cases of discarding
entities.

At this point, development has shifted to 10.2.x and only important fixes will be backported to 10.1.x. Any new features will only become available in 10.2.x, so make sure to start migration to [10.2.x](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/release-notes/10.2.x.html)
soon. 

### Changes since 10.1.12

For a full overview, you can also see the [10.1.13 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/56?closed=1).
