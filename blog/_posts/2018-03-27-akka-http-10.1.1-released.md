Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the release of Akka HTTP 10.1.1, which is the first maintenance release of the Akka Http 10.1 series. If you have not yet already upgraded from 10.0, this would be a good time to do so – the update is for the most part binary and source compatible after all, and brings more features and fixes (see the [10.1.0 release annoucement](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released) for more details).

This release brings a number of small, yet long requested features, including: 

* automatic WebSocket keep-alive using `Ping` frames,
* removing the need for implicit parameters in order to call `Route.seal` (in Scala DSL)

As usual, the release is backwards compatible as outlined in our [binary compatibility guidelines](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/compatibility-guidelines.html). 

### **List of changes (since 10.1.0)**

#### Fixes in akka-http-core

* Minor correction in rejections.md ([#1924](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1924))
* Cache docs: more explicit imports, create cache once ([#1955](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1955))
* Better caching example for Java 

#### Infrastructure and build fixes

* Fully remove OSGi support ([#1943](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1943))
    * Which was already removed and discussed in 10.1.0
