Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. 
Other than the usual hardening and maintenance work, during this period we made a lot of progress on multiple very important new features which we’re very proud to release today.

The most important features are:

* Support for Java 9 across the board (while maintaining Java 8 support)
* Support for [java.util.concurrent.Flow](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) interfaces in Akka Streams [#23578](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23578) 
* Akka Typed API previews for: 
    * Persistence [#22273](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22273) [#23693](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23693) 
    * Cluster [#21226](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21226) 
    * Cluster Singleton [#23613](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/23613) 
    * Cluster Sharding [#23698](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23698)
    * Distributed Data [#23664](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23664) 
    * and the Receptionist [#23634](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/23634)
* First release of [Multi-DC Clustering](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/cluster-dc.html) (preview)

A total of 100 (*sic!*) issues were closed since 2.5.4. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.5](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/118?closed=1) milestone on github.

## Request for feedback of Akka Typed APIs

Please note that all the Akka Typed APIs (persistence, cluster, ...) remain "[ApiMayChange](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/common/may-change.html)", 
as we continue to gather feedback and finalize those APIs over the coming months. We’d like to encourage you to try them out and provide feedback in case you 
encounter some missing or confusing functionality. 

These new APIs do not yet have a full-blown documentation, however we will introduce all the APIs in a fresh blog post series, 
begining with the [Typed Akka Cluster API post](https://akka.io/blog/2017/09/28/typed-cluster) published *right now*, where 
we introduce these Typed APIs–more posts will follow, so please keep an eye on our [blog](https://akka.io/blog/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/akkateam)!

## JDK9 and java.util.concurrent.Flow.* compatibility

This release also marks the first Akka release which is both Java 9 *compatible*, as well as provides support for the new 
[`java.util.concurrent.Flow.*`](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) interfaces, which we are incredibly proud to see shipping in the JDK – as they are the result of the [Reactive Streams](http://reactive-streams.org) initiative that we co-lead and intensely participated in over the last years. The `j.u.c.Flow` interfaces are 1:1 semantically equivalent to their Reactive Streams counterparts, and adhere to the same specification, and can be tested using the same, freely available, [Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/v1.0.1/tck).

Starting today, it is possible to consume/expose Akka Streams directly as *j.u.c.Flow* types, using the `akka.stream.`[[`javadsl`](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-stream/src/main/java-jdk9-only/akka/stream/javadsl/JavaFlowSupport.java)` or `[`scaladsl`](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-stream/src/main/scala-jdk9-only/akka/stream/scaladsl/JavaFlowSupport.scala)]`.JavaFlowSupport` Sinks and Sources. No additional dependency has to be added to make use of these types, other than making sure to compile and run using JDK9. Users of previous versions of Java will not be able to compile or use those types, and are recommended to stick to [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scala/stream/index.html) or Reactive Streams interfaces in case a need for inter-operability between libraries arises.
