Dear hakkers,

After a bit more than a month since Alpakka 1.0-M2, we are delighted to announce the third milestone release of Alpakka 1.0.

Highlights of the new release are:

* Elasticsearch connector now has support for the new Akka Stream context propagation feature
* AWS DynamoDb, Google Cloud Pub/Sub gRPC, Kudu now use Akka Stream attributes to inject needed resources
* Apache Solr, AWS Kinesis, Geode, Google FCM, HBase, HDFS, IronMq, MongoDb, OrientDb, XML connectors have been refactored to more closely follow Alpakka connector guidelines
* Most of the connectors now support Scala 2.13.0-M5
 
For detailed changes and credits take a look at the [release notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/release-notes/1.0-M3.html) in the Alpakka documentation.

Modules that have been changed to meet Alpakka 1.0 standards might get more API-breaking changes before Alpakka reaches 1.0. If you prefer adapting to these changes in one bigger step, keep the version you are using until Alpakka 1.0 is final.

Happy hakking!

– The Alpakka Team
