*Dear hakkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of ***Akka 2.2.3***. This is the second maintenance release of the 2.2 branch, containing documentation improvements and fixing several issues including:

 * Optimized vector clock comparison
 * CompundWrite support for the TCP module that allows batched writes
 * More robust handling of remote system restarts
 * Aggregator pattern, contributed by Akara Sucharitakul

 ... and several smaller fixes

 *This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.*

The reason for the skip in version number, going to 2.2.3 instead of 2.2.2 is that some last minute regressions were found in the 2.2.2 release after it had been mirrored to Maven Central.

### Migrating from Older Releases

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.1.x please have a look at our migration guide:
http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.3/project/migration-guide-2.1.x-2.2.x.html

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the SBT standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10”.
