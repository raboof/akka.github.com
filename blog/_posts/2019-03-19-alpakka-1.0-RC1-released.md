Dear hakkers,

We're seeing the Alpakka 1.0 release in quite short distance now, after travelling the [road to Alpakka 1.0](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/alpakka-towards-1.0) for much longer than we initially planned. We've reached Alpakka 1.0-RC1 and expect only minor changes before releasing 1.0 final!

This release contains only minor changes since 1.0-M3, as described in [the release notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/release-notes/1.0-RC1.html).

Happy hakking!

– The Alpakka Team
