Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.3 release of Akka HTTP. This release is the third update in the 10.2.x series of Akka HTTP.

### Changes since 10.2.2

This release includes a working preview HTTP/2 client. Please consider using this preview to provide early feedback in case you find issues in your use-case. The HTTP/2 client will soon be included as an opt-in backend for the Akka gRPC client.

Native HTTP/2 support in Akka gRPC reduces the number of upstream dependencies and enables more deeply integrated tooling for Akka gRPC in the future.

For now, a connection-level and a "persistent connection" API is provided. The entry points are very similar to the existing flow-based HTTP/1 client APIs (responses are provided out-of-order, though, see the docs). The persistent connection API provides functionality similar to the `newHostConnectionPool` API.

Higher-level APIs for HTTP/2 like the `superPool` or `singleRequest` APIs (or a potential automatic integration into the existing APIs) are still discussed.

Please see the [documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/client-side/http2.html) for more information and usage examples.
