Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.15 are:

- Support joining from Cluster node of version 2.5.9 or earlier to Cluster node of version 2.5.15 [#25491](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25491)
- Improved [ScalaFiddle](https://scalafiddle.io) integration in documentation, see [Akka Streams example](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-quickstart.html#browser-embedded-example) [#25431](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25431), thanks to [@andreaTP](https://github.com/andreaTP)
- Improvements of async-dns [#25451](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25451) and [#25454](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25454)
- New `Sink.takeLast` operator [#25322](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25322) thanks to [@naferx](https://github.com/naferx)

A total of 56 issues were closed since 2.5.14. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.15 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/131?closed=1) on github.

## API changes in Akka Typed

Some of the [improvements](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+label%3At%3Atyped+milestone%3A2.5.15+is%3Aclosed+) to Akka Typed resulted in two small API changes since 2.5.14 and it should be a straight forward migration.

1. The order of `EventHandler` type parameters was switched in `javadsl` of Persistence Typed, [#25188](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25188)

2. `andThen` renamed to `thenRun` in `scaladsl` of Persistence Typed [#25357](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/25357)
