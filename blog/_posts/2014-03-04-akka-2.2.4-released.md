*Dear hakkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of ***Akka 2.2.4***. This is the third maintenance release of the 2.2 branch, containing documentation improvements and fixing several issues including:

 * (remote, cluster) increased numerical precision of PhiAccrualFailureDetector, contributed by Rob David
 * (actor) fixed a regression in Actor overhead concerning both size and creation effort
 * (remote) added the ability to communicate with restarted systems before the quarantine period has elapsed
 * (remote) fixed remote lifecycle logging so that it can be switched off completely
 * documentation fixes

 *This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.2.3, which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.*

### Migrating from Older Releases

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.1.x please have a look at our migration guide:

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central.
