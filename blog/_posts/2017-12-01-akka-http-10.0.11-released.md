Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce Akka Http 10.0.11, the eleventh release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. It marks the one year
anniversary of the 10.0 series. As a special present the community and Akka team worked together to add the long awaited
akka-http-caching module inspired by spray-caching.

It also features a new implementation
of the client pool infrastructure. This will allow us in the future to finally tackle many of the issues reported for the existing
infrastructure like request timeouts, handling unread response entities, and other issues more easily.

In an ongoing behind-the-scenes effort, [@jonas](https://github.com/jonas), [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat) and others
continued to improve the structure of our documentation to consolidate Java and Scala documentation. This reduction in duplication
of documentation content will allow us to make changes to the documentation more easily in the future. Thanks a lot!

### New caching module, akka-http-caching

In a several month long effort members from the community and the Akka team discussed and implemented the long-awaited replacement
of spray-caching. The new module `akka-http-caching` got quite an overhaul over spray-caching and is now backed by
[caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine).

Thanks a lot, [@tomrf1](https://github.com/tomrf1), [@jonas](https://github.com/jonas), [@ben-manes](https://github.com/ben-manes),
[@ianclegg](https://github.com/ianclegg) for the fruitful discussions and for providing the implementation!

The caching API is currently marked with `@ApiMayChange` and thus may change based on feedback from real world usage.
Some improvements are already planned to make it into
[future releases](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3At%3Acaching+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
We hope further collaboration within the community will help us stabilize the API.

See the [documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/common/caching.html) for more information.

### Http Client Pool Infrastructure Rewrite

The existing host connection pool infrastructure has accrued quite a lot of issues that are hard to fix. Therefore, we
decided to rewrite the old version which was based on a stream graph jungle with a new version implemented as a single
`GraphStage` which will be easier to maintain. The new infrastructure already passes all the old tests and is now considered
ready to be tested. The new implementation can be enabled with the feature flag `akka.http.host-connection-pool.pool-implementation = new`.
One important feature that is available only with the new pool implementation is a new warning that will be shown
if user code forgets to read or discard a response entity in time (which is one of the most prominent usage problems with our client
API). If you experienced problems with the old implementation, please try out the new implementation and report any issues
you find.

We hope to stabilize the new implementation as soon as possible and are going to make it the default in a future version.

### Incompatible changes to akka.http.{java,scala}dsl.coding classes

To clean up internal code, we made a few incompatible changes to classes that were previously kept public accidentally.
We now made those classes private and marked them as `@InternalApi`. Affected classes are `akka.http.scaladsl.coding.DeflateDecompressorBase`,
`akka.http.scaladsl.coding.DeflateCompressor`, and `akka.http.scaladsl.coding.GzipCompressor`. The actual codec APIs,
`Gzip` and `Deflate`, are not affected.
This is in violation with a strict reading of our binary compatibility guidelines. We still made that change for
pragmatic reasons because we believe that it is unlikely that these classes have been used or extended by third parties.
If this assumption turns out to be too optimistic and integration with third-party code breaks because of this,
please let us know.
