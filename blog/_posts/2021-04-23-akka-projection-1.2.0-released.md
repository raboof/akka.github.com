Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce the release of Akka Projections 1.2.0.

## Changes since 1.1.0

- New functionality to pause and resume projections, see [documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/management.html#pause-and-resume), [#25](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues/25)
- Fix case of table names problem with `OracleDialect` and default settings, [#543](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/pull/543) by [@ihostage](https://github.com/ihostage)
- Akka 2.6.14 and Jackson 2.11.4, [#541](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/pull/541)
- Rename `createOffsetTableIfNotExists` and `dropOffsetTableIfExists`, [#546](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/pull/546)
- Configurable path of dispatcher for JDBC projections [#542](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/pull/542) by [@ihostage](https://github.com/ihostage)
- Retry management operations if timeout, [#531](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues/531)

This version requires creating the new `projection_management` table, which is used for storing the pause/resume state of the projections. This table is required even if the new pause/resume functionality isn't used. No other database maintenance is required since all existing database elements are compatible.
