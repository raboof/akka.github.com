Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. Some notable improvements and bug fixes in 2.5.19 are:

* Support BackoffSupervisor with ClusterSharding passivation [#19016](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19016)
* Promote service discovery from Akka Management to a core Akka module [#25931](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25931)
   - A new release of Akka Management using this will be released next week as old version of Akka Management won't work with the Akka Discovery module
