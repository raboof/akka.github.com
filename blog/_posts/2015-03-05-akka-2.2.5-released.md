*Dear hakkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of ***Akka 2.2.5***.
This is the fourth maintenance release of the 2.2 branch, and was sponsored by Manhattan Associates, Inc.

It includes a fix concerning filebased durable mailboxes, which might have grown indefinitely on some operating systems.

 *This release is backwards binary compatible with version 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.*

### Migrating from Older Releases

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.1.x please have a look at our migration guide:

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the SBT standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10”.
