*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.11. This is the eleventh maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains a few important fixes:

 - a fix for BatchingExecutor ([#16327](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/16327); symptom is a requirement failure when using blocking{} in Future callbacks)
 - a fix for a performance regression caused by a previous bugfix in IO ([#17391](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17391))
 - a revert of a performance optimization in 2.3.7 that caused actor starvation when multiple dispatchers were involved ([#17341](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17341); critical)

This release also [adds an additional configuration parameter](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17274) for ForkJoinPool as well as [a fix for a wrong setting path](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/17316) in Pinned Dispatcher configuration.

Akka 2.3.11 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.5. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.11/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.11 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.11).
