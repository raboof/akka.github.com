Dear hakkers,

we—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.5.0-RC2 (SECOND RELEASE CANDIDATE). This is what we intend to ship as 2.5.0 final unless issues are found, so please test it thoroughly and report back.

Since the last release candidate two weeks ago we have fixed a few bugs in the new delta-CRDT protocol in Distributed Data. The complete list of closed tickets can be found on the [2.5.0-RC2](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/108?closed=1) milestone on github.

Please refer to the [announcement of 2.5.0-RC1](http://akka.io/news/2017/03/17/akka-2.5.0-RC1-released.html) for more information about upcoming Akka 2.5.0, including a list of key features.

Read the [migration guide](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/project/migration-guide-2.4.x-2.5.x.html) when updating from Akka 2.4.

### Credits

For this release (since 2.5.0.RC1) we had the help of 12 committers – thank you all very much!
