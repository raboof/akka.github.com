Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce Akka Http 10.0.10, which is the tenth release of the Akka Http 10.0 series. This maintenance release includes a number of improvements and
bugfixes:

### Support for HTTP(S) proxies with Authorization

It is now possible to connect to @scala[@ref[HTTP(S) Proxies](client-side/client-transport.md)]@java[@ref[HTTP(S) Proxies](client-side/client-transport.md)]
that require an authorization via an `Proxy-Authorization` header. This can be set up directly on the `ClientTransport` object when configuring the proxy. ([#1213](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1213))

### Documentation for HTTP 2 support (Preview)

Server-side HTTP/2 support, currently available as a preview, has now been
@ref[included in the documentation](server-side/http2.md)
([#1297](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/1297)

### Documentation consolidation

Behind the scenes, a lot of work has been done on the ongoing effort to
consolidate the Java and Scala versions of the documentation, notably
by
Jonas Fonseca and Josep Prat. This will make our documentation more consistent,
higher-quality and more easy to browse and maintain ([#1290](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1290)

### Improvements

* (server) Better error reporting when failing to handle CONNECT requests ([#1315](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1315))
* Add HttpApp.startServer(host, port, system) ([#1294](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1294))
* Preserve the order of repeated parameters when retrieving query string as a multimap ([#1270](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/1270))
* Missing final boundary for empty multipart entities ([#1257](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1257))
* Add Cache-Control 'immutable' value ([#1212](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1212))
* Http2: Inbound flow control ([#737](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/737))

### Bugfixes

* HttpChallenge rendering is broken if realm parameter is None ([#1295](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1295))
* Logging with println in Http2ServerDemux ([#1275](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1275))
* Incorrect request URIs with HTTP/2 ([#1274](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1274)
* HttpResponseParser returns invalid status code for statuses without reason phrase ([#1251](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1251))
* Ensure that no responses are lost when `host-connection-pool.idle-timeout` kicks in ([#1245](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1245))
* Large response entity is truncated over https with 'Connection: close' header ([#1219](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1219))
