Dear hakkers,

We are excited to announce not only a new patch release of Akka 2.5 but also brand new [akka.io](http://akka.io/) website and documentation.

## New documentation

One conclusion from the [community survey 2016](http://akka.io/blog/news/2017/01/17/community-survey-2016-summary.html) was that the getting started experience of Akka must be improved. Therefore we have written completely new [Getting Started](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/guide/introduction.html) and [Quickstart](http://akka.io/try-akka/) guides. 

A special thanks to [Endre Varga](https://github.com/drewhk) who wrote most of the Getting Started guide.

You find the landing page for the documentation at [http://akka.io/docs/](http://akka.io/docs/) 

The documentation tooling has been changed to [Paradox](https://github.com/lightbend/paradox). The markdown syntax and the zero installation will make it easier for contributors to help out with improving the documentation. Such contributions are very welcome and you find instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation).

## Akka 2.5.2

If you are using Cluster Sharding with "remembering entities" there is one important change that requires that you make a change to your code when updating to 2.5.2. To solve a [critical issue #22289](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22289) that could result in duplicate entities when the extractShardId function is changed (e.g. between deployments) there is now a new message `Shard.StartEntity(entityId)` that the `extractShardId` must understand. See example in [Scala](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/cluster-sharding.html#remembering-entities) or [Java](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/java/cluster-sharding.html#remembering-entities).

Some other notable improvements and bug fixes of Akka 2.5.2 are:

* Sharding entities not restarted after full cluster restart in ddata mode, [#22868](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22868)
* Bug in sharding snapshot deletion, [#22916](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/22916)
* Report cause for Akka IO TCP CommandFailed, [#22954](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/22954)
* BackoffSupervisor can reply to messages when child is stopped, [#21213](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21213)

The development branch of Akka Typed has been merged back to master and is included in Akka 2.5.2, see the blog post series starting with [Akka Typed: Hello World in the new API](http://akka.io/blog/2017/05/05/typed-intro.html). The APIs may still change but we are confident that most of it is now stable. We will continue the work by integrating with other parts of Akka, such as Streams, Persistence, and Cluster.

A total of 77 issues were closed since 2.5.1. The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [2.5.2](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/111?closed=1) and [2.5.99-TYPED-M1](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/114?closed=1) milestones on github.
