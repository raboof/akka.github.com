*Dear hAkkers,*

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to be able to announce the availability of Akka 2.3.9. This is the ninth maintenance release of the 2.3 branch. This release contains a few improvements:

 - fix a bug in Remoting that could lead to inconsistent state of system message resend buffer (ResendUnfulfillableException)
 - fix a bug in Clustering that could lead to convergence getting stalled indefinitely if too many nodes crash at the same time
 - fix a bug in FileBasedMailbox that caused file rollover to be ignored on Windows
 
Akka 2.3.9 is released for Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.5. This release is backwards binary compatible with all previous 2.3.x versions which means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one (but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction). Always make sure to use at least the latest version required by any of your project’s dependencies.

### Migrating from Older Relases ###

When migrating an existing project from Akka 2.2.x please have a look at the [migration guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3/project/migration-guide-2.2.x-2.3.x.html).

### Additional Release Details ###

The artifacts comprising this release have been published to https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ and also to Maven Central. In addition, we adopted the sbt standard of encoding the Scala binary version in the artifact name, i.e. the core actor package’s artifactId is “akka-actor_2.10” or “akka-actor_2.11”, respectively.

The complete list of closed tickets can be found in the [2.3.9 github issues milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3.9+is%3Aclosed).
