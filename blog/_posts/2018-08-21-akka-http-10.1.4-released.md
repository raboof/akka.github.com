Dear hakkers,


We are happy to announce the 10.1.4 release of Akka HTTP. 10.1.4 is the fifth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

Among many other things, this release includes a fix for handling early responses in the client, HTTP/2 improvements and many updates to the documentation.

If you are using [Lightbend Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/home.html) with Akka HTTP, remember to also update this to the latest version.
